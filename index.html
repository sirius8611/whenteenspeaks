            The nature seems to be so intense the recent day. The sound of the cicada hiding behind the leaves is louder and louder, taking over the surroundings. The flowers of the vigorous flamboyant trees alongside the streets start to bloom, just like a vigorous firework with its redness. The sun now, like a hardworking person, wakes up earlier with its beautiful faint yellow sunshine and works its best a day before slowly resting behind the buildings. The hotness from the sun also becomes so significant these days: around noon, after absorbing all the heat, the road turns into a pan and the people moving on it now look like shrimps; but then after someday, the shrimps will finally earn what they need: rain, heavyweight ones with thunders and lightnings. All of these could only be one “symptom”: summer. <br><br>

Yes. Summer. A not cool season for adults but it is the best season of the year for the kids. I am no exception. Up until 9th grade, summer was always my favorite time of the year. I was able to put my mind into the things I liked to do without all the worries of school: to go out, to explore, to travel and to make friends. Basically, I was a butterfly and summer is my time to break out of the cocoon. Whenever I think of the past, summertime is always the main part; I even believe that I learned more in just 3 months of summer than in 9 months of schools. <br><br>

But then, high school comes, carrying my hopes and expectations for it to be the best three years of my life, especially during summers. But here I am living in the moment, in the last summer of my high school, feeling completely lost.

          <p>Being a teenager in 21<sup>st</sup> century is wild.
             You can feel lonely and surrounded at the same time. With the rise of social media, you have a society within just a small device; you are surrounded, are heard, are seen.
              Social media basically defines your definition of existence. However, with so many voice, social media is too crowded for one’s voice to be significant. 
              Social media is just a temporary healing since later it could be a poison to the “I”. You can texting your friends and have a fun time with them, but then all of a sudden, just when you guys stop chatting, you start to feel empty, lonely and somewhat frustration. 
              You could cry; you could feel guilty for whatever you done; you could feel clueless about the the world; Worst, you could feel that the road ahead of you is a dead end. 
            <br><br>No longer ignorants, we are acknowledging the world better than ever, our abilities are unlimited, but since we are so young, our understanding of ourself is vague,at least that is what I feel, which may explain for our insecurity and inconfidence. Therefore, as teenage, we should be able to defined ourself on our own. But to do such thing is no easy. For some, the chance to find out their “I” could be like a piece of cake. However, for most, it is not. For me, the knot is tight, trust me when I say it is much tight than normal. What surprise me even more is the things that hinder, challenge me the most: my self and my emotions. This blog is not only to record my journey, both its up and down side, but also the feelings and thoughts throughout.
