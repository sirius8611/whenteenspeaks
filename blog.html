          <p>Being a teenager in 21<sup>st</sup> century is wild.
             You can feel lonely and surround at the same time. With the rise of social media, you have a society within just a small device; you are surrounded, are heard, are seen.
              Social media basically defines your definition of existence. However, with so many voice, social media is too crowded for one’s voice to be significant. 
              Social media is just a temporary healing since later it could be a poison to the “I”. You can texting your friends and have a fun time with them, but then all of a sudden, just when you guys stop chatting, you start to feel empty, lonely and somewhat frustration. 
              You could cry; you could feel guilty for whatever you done; you could feel clueless about the the world; Worst, you could feel that the road ahead of you is a dead end. 
            <br><br>No longer ignorants, we are acknowledging the world better than ever, our abilities are unlimited, but since we are so young, our understanding of ourself is vague,at least that is what I feel, which may explain for our insecurity and inconfidence. Therefore, as teenage, we should be able to defined ourself on our own. But to do such thing is no easy. For some, the chance to find out their “I” could be like a piece of cake. However, for most, it is not. For me, the knot is tight, trust me when I say it is much tight than normal. What surprise me even more is the things that hinder, challenge me the most: my self and my emotions. This blog is not only to record my journey, both its up and down side, but also the feelings and thoughts throughout.
